# CNN-Transformer-based-Encoder-Decoder-Model-for-Nepali-Image-Captioning
Image Captioning using CNN (for image features extraction) and Transformer (for language modelling) in Nepali Language

-> This repo contains two different codes:
  1. Data Translation
  2. CNN-Transformer Implementation

-> There are two code versions in which one has all the detais while other is more simplified. You can work on both of these as per your requirement. 
-> Please star this repo if it was useful in any way as well as cite the corresponding paper given below in your work.

Here are the links for the datasets and paper:
