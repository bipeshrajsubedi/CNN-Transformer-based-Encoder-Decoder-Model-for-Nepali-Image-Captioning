# CNN-Transformer-based-Encoder-Decoder-Model-for-Nepali-Image-CaptioningMany image captioning tasks have been carried out in recent years, the majority of the work being for the English language. A few research works have also been carried out for Hindi and Bengali languages in the domain. Unfortunately, not much research emphasis seems to be given to the Nepali language in this direction. Furthermore, the datasets are also not publicly available in the Nepali language. The aim of this research is to prepare a dataset with Nepali captions and develop a deep learning model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer combined model to automatically generate image captions in the Nepali language.

-> This repo contains two different codes:
  1. Data Translation
  2. CNN-Transformer Implementation

-> There are two code versions in which one has all the detais while other is more simplified. You can work on both of these as per your requirement. 
-> Please star this repo if it was useful in any way as well as cite the corresponding paper given below in your work.
